               <p class="twocolumn">The 69th British Academy Film Awards, more commonly known as the BAFTAs, were held on 14 February 2016 at the Royal Opera House in London, to honour the best British and international contributions to film in 2015. Presented by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), accolades are handed out for the best feature-length film and documentaries of any nationality screened at British cinemas in 2015.

The nominees were announced on 8 January 2016 by Stephen Fry and actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw, with Bridge of Spies and Carol both having the most nominations at nine each. The ceremony was broadcast on BBC One with a two-hour delay. The ceremony was watched by 4.5 million viewers, down from 4.9 million in 2015 and the lowest television audience since 2010.</p>
